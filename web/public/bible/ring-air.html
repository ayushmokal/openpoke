                        <p><img src="r2.png" alt="Ring AIR colours"></p>

                        <h3>More Information</h3>
                        <p>The Ring Air empowers users with deep insights derived from metrics such as movement data, HRV, Heart Rate and Sleep Data. These metrics, when combined with our existing ecosystem of products such as Ultrahuman M1 can provide proactive correlations to take your metabolic health to the next level.</p>
                        <p><img src="r3.png" alt="Ring AIR insights"></p>
                        <p>The Ring is designed to help you understand the factors that affect your metabolism. With the ring you can:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Understand your activity patterns throughout the day with the <strong>Movement Index</strong> based on metabolic equivalents (METs). It counts calories, steps etc.</li>
                            <li>Decode your sleep health with the <strong>Sleep Index</strong> and understand how your sleep quality affects your metabolism.</li>
                            <li>Comprehend body metrics like stress using the <strong>Body Index</strong> based on your heart rate, HRV and body temperature.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Product Overview</h3>
                        <p>The Ring is our next big step towards decoding metabolic health and bringing personalized data-driven insights into everyone's reach.</p>

                        <h4>The Thought &amp; Design behind the ring</h4>
                        <p>Following the Ultrahuman M1, we sought to create a device that could track a more detailed set of metabolic biomarkers while prioritizing <strong>convenience and subtlety</strong>.</p>
                        <p>The result is the <strong>Ultrahuman Ring</strong>, a wearable designed to sit comfortably and discreetly on your finger.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Effortless Tracking:</strong> The Ring continuously monitors your biosignals in the background, making it a truly "wear-and-forget" experience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intentionally Simple:</strong> We deliberately avoided constant notifications, screens, and complex interfaces. The Ring provides a clean, non-intrusive experience, allowing you to access your health data on your own terms through the accompanying app.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>What does the ring do?</h4>
                        <p>The <strong>Ultrahuman Ring</strong> is specifically designed to help you gain a deep understanding of your <strong>metabolic health</strong>. It achieves this by continuously tracking and analyzing key factors that influence your metabolism:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Sleep Quality</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Movement</strong> (Activity)</li>
                            <li><strong>Body Metrics:</strong> Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Heart Rate, and Body Temperature</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Biomarkers for you</h4>
                        <p>To make it easy for you to decode your metabolic health, we give you three different scores for each aspect of your health. These scores help you understand how to optimize your sleep, activity and recovery in a truly personal way.</p>
                        <p><img src="r4.png" alt="Ring AIR biomarkers"></p>

                        <h4>The Movement Index</h4>
                        <p>The <strong>Movement Index</strong> helps you understand your daily activity patterns using a metric called <strong>METs</strong> (Metabolic Equivalents).</p>
                        <p><strong>What are METs?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1 MET:</strong> The energy you burn while completely at rest (your resting metabolic rate).</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Brisk walking is typically around <strong>4 METs</strong>, meaning you are expending four times the energy compared to when you are resting.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>How it helps you:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Understand</strong> your current activity levels.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nudge</strong> you with personalized and recommended activities to help you improve your score and encourage you to keep moving throughout the day.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>The Sleep Index</h4>
                        <p>The <strong>Sleep Index</strong> allows you to decode your sleep quality and see a breakdown of your sleep stages throughout the night. Poor sleep quality affects your metabolic health and poor metabolic health affects your sleep quality creating a feedback loop. The Ultrahuman ring lets you derive correlations between how your sleep stages like REM/NREM affect your metabolism and vice-versa, thus becoming your key to unlock the mysteries of a good night sleep and a well rested heart.</p>

                        <h4>The Recovery Index / Dynamic Recovery</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Ring AIR's Dynamic Recovery is an aggregate measure of five parameters determining your body's preparedness for the next day and changes throughout the day. It is a percentage measure from 0-100, a higher (85 or above) number indicating better recovery.</li>
                            <li>The Dynamic Recovery has six factors which include sleep index, skin temperature, stress rhythm score, resting heart rate, HRV form and last night HRV.</li>
                            <li>Dynamic Recovery is dynamic and can be improved throughout the day by regulating stress, maintaining good sleep and sleep hygiene, proper exercise routine, eating balanced and timely meals, hydrating well and including cold therapy and active recovery.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>What is the ring made of?</h4>
                        <p>The Ultrahuman is designed to be tough on the outside and comfortable on the inside. The ring is crafted using:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A Titanium alloy billet for the body.</li>
                            <li>A super durable Tungsten Carbide coating which is 5 times harder than Tool Steel making it remarkably scratch-resistant and ready to take on everyday wear and tear.</li>
                            <li>Medical grade transparent material on the insides that have been tested safe to be used even for implanting inside the human body.</li>
                            <li>The ring is designed hypoallergenic and can be worn for multiple days without causing any harm to the skin.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The inside shape of the ring has multiple sections for each sensor protruding towards your finger, separated by a streamlined design with filleted edges to enable the sensors to take accurate readings while still keeping the Ultrahuman Ring comfortable enough to wear for weeks on end.</p>

                        <h4>Physical Dimensions</h4>
                        <p>The exact diameter and weight are dependent on the specific size chosen.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Smallest Ring (Size 5):</strong> Approximately 16.17 mm in diameter and 2.4 grams in weight.</li>
                            <li><strong>Largest Ring (Size 14):</strong> Approximately 24.91 mm in diameter and 3.7 grams in weight.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Here is how this convergence works:</strong></p>

                            <li><strong>Movement &amp; Glucose Data: Predictive Spikes</strong>
                                <p><strong>The power:</strong> You receive predictive insights based on your historical glucose patterns.</p>
                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If eating pizza previously caused a high glucose spike, the next time you log it, the system will recommend personalized movement goals (for example, a brisk walk) to help mitigate or "cut" the expected spike before it happens.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Sleep &amp; Glucose Data: Real-Time Recovery Impact</strong>
                                <p><strong>The power:</strong> See in real-time how your sleep quality affects your physiological recovery (HRV) and how both variables influence glucose regulation.</p>
                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your historical data shows that poor sleep leads to higher-than-usual glucose spikes for the same meal, the Ring and M1 work together:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The <strong>Ring</strong> signals poor sleep/recovery.</li>
                                    <li>The <strong>M1</strong> confirms the higher glucose spike.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cohesive Insight:</strong> You get a complete picture showing that lack of recovery is making you less insulin sensitive.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>The power:</strong> Get real-time updates on your stress levels and recovery based on your Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Paired with glucose data, you can understand the deeper correlations between emotional/physiological stress and <strong>stress-induced glucose spikes</strong>.</p>

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>The ring can be worn on the index, middle, or ring finger (any hand will do). The fit should be snug (not too tight or too loose). To take the ring off, you must push the bottom of the ring from below and then slide it out.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A few simple ways to assess this: If you rotate the ring on your finger, it should not rotate freely (as seen in the video below).</li>
                            <li>The ring has been worn on the index finger in the video, but the same applies to the ring finger and middle finger as well.</li>
                            <li>Users can be redirected to this YouTube video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9ca-Lq70q4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9ca-Lq70q4</a></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Orientation of the ring</h4>
                        <p>There are sensors on the ring that light up every few minutes, they must always be touching the palm-side of your finger like this.</p>

                        <h4>Important Points</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We can offer one-time size changes and cover end-to-end costs for replacements in such cases.</li>
                            <li>If a user has sold their ring / passed it on to a friend, we cannot entertain size-change requests for the second user.</li>
                            <li>When users reach out with fit issues, share #ring_fit_faq macro. If the ring does not fit, always push for the sizing kit to be sent so the users can find their perfect fit.</li>
                            <li>In case of impatient users, let them know that this is a one-time size change replacement and we will not be able to exchange the ring again. If they are fine with it, we can proceed to replace and get the ring RTO'd.</li>
                            <li>Unless it is been less than 30 days since the ring has been activated, we cannot help with size change requests. Cannot replace old rings with fit issues.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>This SOP applies to all rings that show <strong>manufacturing-related internal damage</strong>, including visible cracks, bubbles, sharp edges, melted surfaces, or similar defects.</p>
                        <p><img src="damage.png" alt="Damaged ring example"></p>

                        <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>

                        <h4>Step 1: Collect Context</h4>
                        <p>Ask the user if there has been any <strong>physical damage or unusual usage</strong> (we can use the macro <strong>Ring_Hardware_Damaged</strong>) including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Exposure to extreme temperatures</li>
                            <li>Activities like deep-sea diving</li>
                            <li>Significant impact or accidental damage</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This helps with internal assessment and quality feedback.</p>

                        <h4>Step 2: Initiate Replacement</h4>
                        <p>Proceed with a replacement for the affected ring without delay.</p>

                        <h4>Step 3: Report Case Internally</h4>
                        <p>Share the case details in <strong>#ultrahuman-ring-cx</strong>, including a short summary and relevant photos if available.</p>
                        <p>Tag <strong>@mechdesign</strong> for visibility and they will be determining if <strong>RTO is required</strong>.</p>
